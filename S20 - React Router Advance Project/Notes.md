V. 284 - Data Fetching with a loader()
- React router to start fetching the data as soon as we navigate to the page. 
  - Fetch the data first, then render the page.... 
    - rather than rendering the page and then loading the data.
- Property add to the route definition. 
  - loader property 
    - expects a function as a value
    - function is executed right before that route is rendered.
    - react will take any data that you return within a loader function and make it available on that page & any other pages you may need it. 
    - response object = object with events property (= array of events)
  - React router will check if a promise has been returned and get that data for you.
